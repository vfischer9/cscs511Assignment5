In this project I cloned my previous Spltitwise Calculator. 

I rendered a sign in page that allows users to log in with their correct user name and
password. If they don't have one, they can sign up. After logging in, the user has access to
the splitwise calculator app.

Once logged in, they can choose to log out or delete their account entirely. If they delete their
account they cannot sign in with their username or password unless they create a new account.

If they refresh the page, the user will still be signed in and be able to use the splitwise 
calculator, and their data will be saved.

Local storage stores the user's name and password as well as the data stored in the calculator if they wish to return at a later time.
